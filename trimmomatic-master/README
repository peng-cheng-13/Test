Trimmomatic
===========

This directory contains the code of Trimmomatic, a  flexible read trimming
tool for Illumina NGS data. The official maintainer is Anthony Bolger and the
official web page is here:
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic

As the code is available under the GPL, and I, Timoth√©e Flutre, needed to make
a few changes, I started working on version 0.33 of the tool, just after
versioning it with git.


Installation
============

For the impatients:
	make
	make check
	make install

By default everything is installed in a directory bin/ in ${HOME}. 
If the bin/ directory does not exist, it will be created.
To install elsewhere, use the option INSTALL, for instance: 
	make install INSTALL="/usr/local/"
